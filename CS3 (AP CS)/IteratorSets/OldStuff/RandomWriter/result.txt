he plank. His bone 
leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated, and holding 
by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight 
out beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an 
infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrender- 
able wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedi- 
cation of that glance. Not a word he spoke ; nor did 
his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest 
gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, 
if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled 
master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken 
Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; 
in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some 
mighty woe. 

Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into 
his cabin. But after that morning, he was every day 
visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot -hole, 
or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking 
the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed, began 
to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse ; 
as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but 
the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him 
so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he 
was almost continually in the air ; but, as yet, for all that 
he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he 
seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the 
Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly 
cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing super- 
vision the mates were fully competent to, so that there 
was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite

Ahab now ; and thus chase away, for that one interval, 
the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his 
brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile 
themselves upon. 

Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasive- 
ness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed 
gradually to charm him from his mood. For, as when the 
red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to 
the wintry, misanthropic woods ; even the barest, 
ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send 
forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad- 
hearted visitants ; so Ahab did, in the end, a little 
respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More 
than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, 
which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out 
in a smile. 






CHAPTER XXIX 

TO HIM, STUBB 

SOME days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the 
Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, 
which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold 
of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, 
clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, 
were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up 
flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately 
nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing 
at home in lonely pride,
