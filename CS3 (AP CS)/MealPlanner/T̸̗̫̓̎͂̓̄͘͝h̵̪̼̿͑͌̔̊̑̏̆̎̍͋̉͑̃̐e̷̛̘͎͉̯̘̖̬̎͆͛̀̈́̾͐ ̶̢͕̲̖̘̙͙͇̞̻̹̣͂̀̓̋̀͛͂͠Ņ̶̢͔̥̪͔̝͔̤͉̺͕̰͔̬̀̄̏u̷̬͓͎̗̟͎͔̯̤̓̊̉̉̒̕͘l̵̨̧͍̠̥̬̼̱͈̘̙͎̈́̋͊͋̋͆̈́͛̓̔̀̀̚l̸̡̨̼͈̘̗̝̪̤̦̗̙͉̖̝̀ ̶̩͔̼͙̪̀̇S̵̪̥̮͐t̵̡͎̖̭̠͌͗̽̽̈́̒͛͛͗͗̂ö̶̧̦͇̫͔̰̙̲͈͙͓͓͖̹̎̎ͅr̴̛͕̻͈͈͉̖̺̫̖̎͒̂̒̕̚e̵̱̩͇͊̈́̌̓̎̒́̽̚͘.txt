========================================================================

	Things had gotten bad. COVID had gotten much worse, and a state of emergency and a shelter in 
place order had been declared. Of course, they allowed essential travel, such as buying needed items
from stores. Not that it mattered anyway, since the stores had been ransacked of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, masks, and everything else that I had gone to the store for in the first place by panicked shoppers. So here I was, walking dejectedly back home, after unsuccessfully buying these items the third time in a row.
	As I was walking through an alleyway, I saw a door, with an aged sign hanging above it. The store had no name. At least, that's what I thought, as there was nothing where the name should’ve been. Instead, the sign just said “     Store”. There weren't even any marks of paint; it looked like the name had never been there. I looked past that: it could’ve just been an honest mistake, and opened the door. I was confused that there was a store there, as I was 99% sure these buildings were a row of townhouses. 
	The store was a lot bigger than it looked from the outside: it looked more like a supermarket than an alleyway shop, and I was a bit confused about how it could fit in such a small space. There was no one in sight, not even employees. The cash register was unmanned, and when I took a closer look, I saw a sign saying, “No cashier present - self checkout only.” I understood why they did this, considering the situation, but there didn’t seem to be anything stopping people from just stealing everything. 
	I decided to see if I could find the things I was looking for in this store. I grabbed a shopping cart, and started looking around. I soon found something I thought I’d never see again - a fully stocked shelf of toilet paper. “How has no one known about this?” I thought. I grabbed one. It seemed a bit off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I ignored it, as I couldn’t pass up this much. I soon found similarly stocked shelves of masks, hand sanitizers, disinfectants - everything I was looking for. I grabbed a copious amount of each, and was about to turn back when I noticed some pies on a nearby table. 
I immediately recognized it as my favorite type, which was no longer available, as the local bakery no longer sold it. I took that too, and was about to turn back when I noticed some instant noodles. There were my favorites that had been ransacked when the pandemic started. I grabbed those too.
All these items that I was finding were items I wasn’t able to find in any other store, and I was very excited at this. I piled my shopping cart higher and higher, as I found more stuff. However, soon, the time came when I ran out of space in my cart, and had to go back to checkout. So I regretfully turned around and made my way back. 
I soon found that though I thought I was retracing my steps perfectly(I have a pretty good sense of direction), nothing looked familiar. I didn’t feel like I was getting any closer to the exit. I was lost. I realized I must have walked at least a mile; a store of this size could not have existed in such a small place. It was somehow much bigger on the inside. This was no normal store.
As I kept walking, I saw a billboard saying, “Buy one barrel of gasoline and get a banana free!” Such weird deals could only be some sort of joke, but of course, this store broke the laws of physics. However, I soon saw another one: “Buy 5000 lbs. of sand, 1 brick, and 300 bricks for only -$6.99!” “Why?” I thought. I soon saw similar billboards all over the place, confirming my suspicions that this probably wasn’t a joke. It was then I looked at a price tag for a loaf of bread, priced at, “$5+2i? That doesn’t make sense at all.” I had a feeling I really needed to get out of here. Who knew what this place held? I walked a little faster.
A few minutes later, I found something else. On a shelf, there was a carrot. Or rather two carrots, that were inside each other, as if one had stabbed the other through the middle. I broke them apart, but the inside looked wrong. It shifted between different hues of orange impossibly fast, like when objects are clipped together in a video game. It looked like a glitch in reality, and that scared me. If the whole store was like this, I may not be safe. I soon saw something else that confirmed my suspicions - a row of items, splattered on the ground as if dropped from a height, right next to an empty shelf. It seemed like they were supposed to be on the shelf, but instead were just dropped in midair. On the other side, the items were inside the center of the shelf. I looked down, and saw that the legs of the shelves were an inch inside the floor. I needed to get out soon - things were just getting more and more weird.
Eventually I found a hole. It was just black; pitch black. I threw something in, and watched it disappear into the void, falling as far as I could see. It seemed to span forever, with no bounds in sight, even though the aisle next to me went on right where the void should be. It was as if part of the store had just been deleted. Soon, I saw something horrifying: right beside me, a hole appeared, and slowly grew larger. Items and shelves fell in, as it grew to the size of a small car. I stepped back right in time before it swallowed me in. I walked back, but I noticed another growing hole in the wall, as a shelf fell into it. I abandoned my shopping cart and ran.
This store, one that should not exist, barely hanging on to reality, was starting to collapse in on itself. Growing black voids appearing everywhere. I kept running, dodging them as the walls cracked, even though I knew it was futile. I knew the more I ran, the deeper I would go into the store, even if I went in the opposite direction. I would eventually run out of speed, and fall into a hole; it was only a matter of time, the exit was nowhere in sight. I was not even sure there was an exit anymore. 
I kept running, seemingly getting nowhere. As I turned around, I stopped in surprise. There it was: the exit, with its empty kiosks and the one thing I needed most: a door. I ran towards it, jumping over the numerous voids that were appearing much more quickly now. I opened the door, and jumped through, landing on cold hard concrete.
I stood up in an alleyway. Above me, loomed an unfamiliar skyline, and behind me, there was a blank wall, and no door. But it didn’t matter. I escaped. I was out of that hellish place. I was safe.
