Problem 1:
a.
      1
   2     4
 5   3

b.
      1
   2     3
 4   5 6   7

Problem 2:
b.
The children of A may be less than C. To fix it, we need to assume that all children of A are greater than C. If this happens, then bubbling up maintains this, as B and all its children are greater than C which is greater than A.

Problem 3:
a.
P(k) = (k+k%2)/2-1

b.
L(k) = 2k+1
R(k) = 2k+2
